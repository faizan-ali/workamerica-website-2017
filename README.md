## Editing content
To edit content on the main pages (employer/educators/job seekers) you can edit the corresponding JSON files in ./src/static/content/

### Using the JSON files
Each section on the page has a dedicated object in the JSON file. You can't add extra sections to the page. However, you can add extra benefits- and feature-items by adding more objects to each array.

### Broke something?
Make sure you closed all double quotes and didn't forget any comma's.
