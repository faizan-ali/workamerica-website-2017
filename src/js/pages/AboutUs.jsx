          <h1>We are flipping recruiting on its head</h1>
          <p>
            We have employers search for candidates, instead of having candidates wade through hundreds of job applications, guessing if they are a good fit for the position. And since we only allow trained and credentialed talent to join WorkAmerica, employers no longer have to dig through thousands of unqualified resumes to find that right employee.
