          <p>
            At WorkAmerica, we are tackling the biggest social issue to face our generation: the future of work. In the face of multiple challenges, including the skills gap, automation, shifting demographics, and legislative uncertainty,  we are helping our country&#39;s workforce adapt to and prepare for the changing job market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision grows from the 3 pillars below.

          <h1>Giving the other half of America&#39;s job seekers a professional online presence.</h1>
          <p>
            WorkAmerica gives skilled workers an online professional presence and recruitment marketplace, long available to white collar professionals but, never before designed for this demographic. And this demographic fills 55% of all job openings in America each year! This is the first step in fixing the broken education-to-employment pipeline.

          <h1>Closing the Skills Gap with Big Data</h1>
          <p>
            Using the data we will track around schools&#39; enrollment and placement outcomes, side by side with employers&#39; real time hiring needs, we&#39;ll uncover countless opportunites to better align industry needs with training opportunities. We&#39;ll bring educators and employers to the same table and enable them to take transformative action, substantiated by real, hard numbers.

          <h1>Building the Future of Workforce Services </h1>
          <p>
            As the job market changes increasingly more quickly, workers will need a whole new set of workforce services. These will range from skills retraining to career planning and flexible student aid, to yet un-imagined services. We envision a whole ecosystem of these wraparound services delivered to our country&#39;s workers, via the WorkAmerica platform.
