          <h1>What Personal Information Do We Collect on the Site?</h1>
          <p>
            Information You Volunteer. We collect the personal information You knowingly and voluntarily provide when You use the Site, for example, the information You provide when You register to use the Site including via paper signup form, post any comment on the Site, or when You submit any feedback on the Site. We may also collect Your name, email address, user name, and password when You register and set up an account on the Site or contact Us by email or other means for any reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We may collect information that is sent to Us automatically by Your Web browser, such as Your IP address, the address of the Web page You were visiting when You accessed the Site or an advertisement hosted by Us on a third party Website, information on Your operating system and browser, and the date and time of Your visit. The information We receive depends on the settings on Your Web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information provided by Your browser does not identify You personally. We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help Us improve the Site and Our business. We may also share some of this information with other users of the Site, such as employers who are our actual or potential customers. In addition, We may review Our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into Our network. If We suspect criminal activity, We might share Our server logs -- which contain visitorsâ€™ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

            Information Collected Using &#34;Cookies&#34; and Other Web Technologies. Like many commercial sites, We use &#34;cookies,&#34; and similar technologies to collect information and manage the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on Your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to Your computer. We may use two types of cookies -- &#34;session cookies&#34; and &#34;persistent cookies.&#34;
          </p>
          <p>
            A &#34;session cookie&#34; assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to Your computer when You access the Site or advertisements hosted by Us on third party Websites. A session cookie expires after You close Your browser. Generally, We use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use the Site. This information is known as &#34;click-stream information.&#34; Session cookies may also be used to facilitate Your interactions with the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            A &#34;persistent cookie&#34; does not expire when You close Your browser. A persistent cookie will stay on Your computer until it expires or You delete it. Each time You visit the Site, Our Web server will recognize You by &#34;searching&#34; the information contained in these cookies. By assigning Your computer a persistent, unique identifier, We are able to create a database of Your previous choices and preferences. This permits Us to offer You a personalized experience when You use the Site, as well as to enable potential employers to identify suitable job seekers, or for other purposes connected with Our business. Assigning Your computer a persistent, unique identifier also helps Us keep a more accurate account of how many people visit the Site, how often they return, how their use of the Site may vary over time, and the effectiveness of Our promotional efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither session cookies nor persistent cookies identify You personally. If, however, You access the Site by clicking on a link in an email We have sent You, We may link the information collected by Our cookies to information that identifies You personally.
          </p>
          <p>
            If You do not wish to receive cookies, You may set Your browser to reject cookies or to alert You when a cookie is placed on Your computer. You may also delete Our cookies as soon as You leave the Site. Although You are not required to accept Our cookies when You visit the Site, if You set Your browser to reject cookies, You will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the Site.

          <p>
            No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to Us and You do so at Your own risk. We have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect Your personal information while it is under Our control. When You send information to Us during the registration process or access Your account information, We will use a secure. The WorkAmerica platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) where state of the art cloud security is of the utmost importance. All the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes are employed to ensure data security and integrity. The data itself is stored in a MySQL database that is completely blocked off from all internet traffic, allowing access only to the application itself. The platform is built to negate the chances of any SQL injection, offering defense against other common web vulnerabilities such as unvalidated inputs and broken access control (to ensure one student cannot somehow access the data of another).

            In addition, Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. Please be aware, however, that despite Our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, You must keep Your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using Your password. Please advise Us immediately if You believe Your password has been misused.
